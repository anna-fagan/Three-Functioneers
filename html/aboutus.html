    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <div class="paragraph-box">
            Our mission is to make it easier for people to give their items a second life—
            whether by selling them at an affordable price or donating them to someone who
            truly needs them. We aim to create a simple, friendly platform where communities 
            can connect, share resources, and reduce waste together.

        <h2>The Problem We're Solving</h2>
        <div class="paragraph-box">
            Every day, perfectly usable items are thrown away simply because people don’t have a convenient way to pass them on. Meanwhile, many individuals struggle to find affordable essentials. Our website bridges this gap by offering a place where people can sell unwanted items or donatethem with ease. By making reuse simple and accessible, we help reduce waste, save money, and support local communities.
